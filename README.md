# NewsSpring

## Project instructions

Your task is to create a simple REST API framework that interacts with a public news API for fetching articles. For the back-end, you have to use the Java language and Spring framework. For example, you can use the GNews API and then create your own API service, with documentation, that interacts with this API for fetching articles.

You API should have a few basic methods like, fetching N news articles, finding a news article with a specific title or author, and searching by keywords. Include a cache in your API service as well so users are not fetching the same things over and over.
